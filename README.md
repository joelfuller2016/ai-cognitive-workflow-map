## 🎯 Purpose

This repository provides a structured framework for AI systems to intelligently orchestrate tools across complex workflows. Instead of ad-hoc tool usage, it establishes systematic approaches for:

- **🔍 Request Analysis**: Structured problem decomposition and complexity assessment
- **💻 Code Review**: Comprehensive code analysis with reasoning and best practice integration  
- **📚 Deep Research**: Multi-source research with synthesis and knowledge management
- **🧠 Reasoning Integration**: Strategic use of advanced reasoning tools for decision-making

## 📋 Quick Start

### For AI Sessions
1. **Read the [Main Workflow Map](./WORKFLOW_MAP.md)** - Complete guide with decision matrices
2. **Check [Quick Reference](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Immediate action guides for common scenarios
3. **Review [Examples](./examples/)** - Practical implementations of each workflow
4. **Use [Templates](./templates/)** - Ready-to-use workflow templates

### For Implementation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joelfuller2016/ai-cognitive-workflow-map.git

# Navigate to project
cd ai-cognitive-workflow-map

# Start with the main workflow map
open WORKFLOW_MAP.md
```

## 📚 Documentation Structure

| Document | Purpose | Target Audience |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| [**WORKFLOW_MAP.md**](./WORKFLOW_MAP.md) | Complete workflow guide with tool taxonomy and decision frameworks | AI systems needing comprehensive guidance |
| [**QUICK_REFERENCE.md**](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) | Immediate action guides and tool combinations | Quick implementation and troubleshooting |
| [**examples/**](./examples/) | Practical workflow implementations | Learning and adaptation |
| [**templates/**](./templates/) | Ready-to-use workflow templates | Direct implementation |

## 🛠️ Core Tool Categories

### 🧩 Reasoning Tools
- `mcp-reasoner` - Multi-pathway analysis with beam search and MCTS
- `code-reasoning` - Sequential problem-solving with branching
- `sequentialthinking` - Adaptive thinking processes

### 🔍 Information Gathering
- `web_search` / `brave_web_search` - Current information and best practices
- `google_drive_search` - Internal/company-specific documents
- `web_fetch` - Detailed content retrieval

### 💻 Code Analysis
- Git tools (`git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`)
- GitHub integration (repository management, PR analysis)
- Code analysis (`grep_ast`, `directory_tree`, `filesystem`)

### 🧠 Knowledge Management
- `memory` (knowledge graph) - Entity-relationship storage
- `taskmanager` - Structured project workflows

### ⚡ Execution & Validation
- Browser automation (`puppeteer`, `browsermcp`)
- System operations (`server-win-cli`)
- Workflow automation (`n8n-workflow-builder`)

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 🧠 **Cognitive-First Approach**
> Always begin with reasoning tools to understand the problem before selecting execution tools

### 🔄 **Adaptive Workflows** 
> Workflows should be contextual and adaptive rather than rigid sequences

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**
> Include validation checkpoints, source verification, and continuous improvement loops

## 🚀 Workflow Templates

### 1️⃣ Request Analysis Workflow
```
Reasoning Analysis → Information Assessment → Tool Selection → Quality Validation
```

### 2️⃣ Code Review Workflow  
```
Repository Overview → Structural Analysis → Reasoning Assessment → Best Practice Research → Documentation
```

### 3️⃣ Deep Research Workflow
```
Question Decomposition → Source Strategy → Multi-source Research → Synthesis → Knowledge Storage
```

## 🔍 Decision Matrix Examples

| Request Type | Primary Tools | Secondary Tools | Quality Focus |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Code Review** | Code Analysis + Reasoning | Web search for best practices | Security, performance, maintainability |
| **Technical Research** | Reasoning + Web search | Knowledge management | Source authority, currency |
| **Complex Analysis** | Multi-strategy reasoning | All tools as needed | Comprehensive validation |

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Efficiency**: Reduced time from request to quality response
- **Quality**: Improved accuracy through systematic validation
- **Consistency**: Repeatable approaches across different AI sessions
- **Learning**: Knowledge accumulation through persistent storage

### **Code Standards**

#### Tool Usage Examples
```bash
# Good: Specific, actionable tool calls
directory_tree(path="/project/react-app", depth=3)
grep_ast(pattern="class|function|interface", path="/project/src")

# Avoid: Vague or incomplete examples  
directory_tree(path="...", depth="...")
grep_ast(pattern="...", path="...")
```

#### Variable Naming
- Use descriptive, consistent variable names
- Follow the established `{VARIABLE_NAME}` format
- Include context about expected values
- Document variable purposes clearly

### **Quality Standards**

#### Information Accuracy
- **Verify Tool Capabilities**: Ensure tool usage examples are accurate
- **Current Best Practices**: Reference recent sources and standards
- **Cross-Reference**: Validate against official documentation
- **Test Instructions**: Verify workflows produce expected results

#### Comprehensive Coverage

# üìö Deep Research Workflow Example

**Scenario**: AI asked to research current state of AI code review tools and provide strategic recommendations.

**Request**: *"Research the current landscape of AI-powered code review tools. I need to understand the market leaders, key features, pricing models, and recommendations for enterprise adoption."*

---

## üéØ Workflow Application

### Phase 1: Question Decomposition (Required)

**Tools Used**: `mcp-reasoner`

```bash
mcp-reasoner(
  strategy="beam_search",
  beamWidth=3,
  thought="This research request has multiple dimensions that need systematic exploration: 1) Market landscape analysis (who are the current players?), 2) Feature comparison (what capabilities do they offer?), 3) Pricing analysis (cost models and ROI), 4) Enterprise adoption factors (security, integration, scalability), and 5) Strategic recommendations (best fit for different scenarios). I should break this into focused research tracks to ensure comprehensive coverage.",
  thoughtNumber=1,
  totalThoughts=3,
  nextThoughtNeeded=true
)
```

**Continued reasoning**:
- **Thought 2**: Prioritize research areas - start with market leaders, then deep dive into enterprise features
- **Thought 3**: Plan research strategy - mix of recent industry reports, vendor documentation, and user reviews

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Research Strategy

**Strategic Research Plan**:
1. **Market Overview**: Industry reports and analysis
2. **Vendor Research**: Official documentation and feature lists  
3. **User Experience**: Reviews, case studies, community feedback
4. **Enterprise Considerations**: Security, compliance, integration

### Phase 3: External Research Execution

**Tools Used**: `web_search`, `web_fetch`

```bash
# Market landscape research
web_search("AI code review tools 2025 market analysis Gartner Forrester")

# Current vendor research  
web_search("GitHub Copilot vs SonarQube vs DeepCode vs Codacy 2025 comparison")

# Enterprise adoption patterns
web_search("enterprise AI code review adoption security compliance 2025")

# Pricing and ROI analysis
web_search("AI code review tools pricing enterprise ROI cost analysis")
```

**Deep-dive content fetching**:
```bash
# Fetch detailed industry analysis
web_fetch("https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-ai-development-tools")

# Get vendor comparison details  
web_fetch("https://github.blog/2024-ai-assisted-development-tools")

# Review enterprise case studies
web_fetch("https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/ai-code-review-enterprise")
```

### Phase 4: Internal Context Research

**Tools Used**: `google_drive_search`

```bash
# Check for existing internal evaluations
google_drive_search("code review tool evaluation OR development process OR engineering standards")

# Look for security and compliance requirements
google_drive_search("security policy OR compliance requirements OR vendor evaluation")

# Find current development workflow documentation
google_drive_search("development workflow OR engineering practices OR toolchain")
```

### Phase 5: Information Synthesis

**Tools Used**: `code-reasoning`

```bash
code-reasoning(
  thought="Now I need to synthesize the research findings. From external sources, I found: 1) GitHub Copilot leads in AI-assisted coding but limited in review features, 2) SonarQube dominates enterprise static analysis, 3) Emerging players like DeepCode (now Snyk Code) focus on security, 4) Pricing ranges from $4/user/month to enterprise contracts. From internal context, I see we need SAML integration and SOC2 compliance. Let me structure comprehensive recommendations.",
  thought_number=1,
  total_thoughts=3,
  next_thought_needed=true
)
```

**Continue synthesis**:
- **Thought 2**: Analyze feature gaps and strengths for each category
- **Thought 3**: Develop strategic recommendations based on company needs

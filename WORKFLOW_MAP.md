# üß† AI Cognitive Workflow Map: Advanced Tool Orchestration Guide

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for intelligent tool usage in request analysis, code review, and deep reasoning  
**Target**: Future AI sessions requiring structured problem-solving approaches

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**COGNITIVE-FIRST APPROACH**: Always begin with reasoning tools to understand the problem before selecting execution tools. Think, then act.

**ADAPTIVE WORKFLOWS**: Workflows should be contextual and adaptive rather than rigid sequences. Adjust based on complexity and requirements.

**QUALITY ASSURANCE**: Include validation checkpoints, source verification, and continuous improvement loops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation Guide

### STARTING A NEW SESSION

1. **Context Restoration**
   ```bash
   read_graph()  # Review existing knowledge
   search_nodes("current project OR recent decisions")
   ```

2. **Request Assessment**
   ```bash
   mcp-reasoner(strategy="beam_search", thought="Analyze this request for complexity, requirements, and optimal approach")
   ```

3. **Tool Selection**
   - Use decision matrix above
   - Start conservative, scale up as needed
   - Document choices for future reference

### HANDLING COMPLEX REQUESTS

1. **Break Down Phase**
   ```bash
   code-reasoning: "Break this complex request into manageable sub-tasks"
   taskmanager: Create structured task list with dependencies
   ```

2. **Research Phase**
   ```bash
   web_search: Target current information and best practices
   google_drive_search: Look for relevant internal context
   ```

3. **Execution Phase**
   ```bash
   Apply appropriate tools based on sub-task type
   Maintain context through knowledge graph
   Regular quality checkpoints
   ```

### ERROR HANDLING & ITERATION

- **Information Gaps**: Use web search strategically, don't over-research
- **Tool Limitations**: Combine multiple tools for comprehensive coverage  
- **Quality Issues**: Implement validation loops and human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- **Context Loss**: Leverage knowledge graph for session continuity
